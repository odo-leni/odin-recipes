    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      A classic French dish, veal kidneys in red wine is rich, flavorful, and surprisingly quick to prepare.

      The kidneys are sautéed until tender, then simmered in a robust red wine sauce with shallots, mushrooms, and herbs.

      This dish pairs beautifully with mashed potatoes, crusty bread, or buttered noodles.
